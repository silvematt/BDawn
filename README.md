BDawn is an RPG Browser-Game Engine written in Node, JS, HTML, CSS and MySQL, inspired by the browser games of the era like Gladiatus and OGame.

This is a learning project, not meant for actual use if not modified and secured, it has been written with a scalable and prone to changes architecture for what regards the core of functionalities and the content-side of it. Adding content such as weapons, AI, spells and rebalancing the game does not require any significant change in the server-side codebase but an edit of the configuration file of the elements.
